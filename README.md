# Restic-Scripts
A collection of restic BASH scripts for making and managing backups.

The wsl-drvfs folder contains scripts that were used on Windows Subsystem for Linux. These scripts are bit more powerful and well-commented.  They allow for more user-interaction and also include code to mount a network drive using drvfs.
